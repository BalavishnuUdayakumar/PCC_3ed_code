# PCC_3ed_code
Example codes based on ideas from the book "Python Crash Course, 3rd edition" by Eric Matthes.

Note: 
1. Example codes closely follow the same ideas from the book.
2. However, I have created new examples in most cases.
3. I am doing this to improve my own understanding.
4. I keep on modifying codes in here every now and then.
